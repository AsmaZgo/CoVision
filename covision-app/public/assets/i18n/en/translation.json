  "infoText": "The CoVision app helps you evaluate your Covid rapid test safely and robustly. The first step is to detect the position of your rapid test using technology similar to the TapTapSee, SeeingAI or BeMyEyes app. This happens within a few milli-seconds if the camera is correctly positioned about 30cm above the rapid test. Then, in a second step, the detected rapid test is viewed in detail and the result of the rapid test is evaluated using artificial intelligence. Our AI can assign your test to four following categories: positive, negative, blank or invalid. The probability that a test will be assigned to a correct category is currently around 90%. In the final step, the result of your quick test is read out to you.",
