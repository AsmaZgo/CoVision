273 million visually disabled and blind people around the world do not have access to covid rapid tests due to exclusively visual steps and results.

**We would like to change this.**

CoVision app identifies a covid test result (positive/negative) using AI and reads it out loud. Users also have the option to scan the test kit's barcode, and have the instructions read out to them.
